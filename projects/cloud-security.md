# Cloud Security Program (AWS / Azure)

## Objective
Design, implement, and govern a comprehensive cloud security program
to protect organizational data, applications, and infrastructure
operating across AWS and Azure environments while supporting
remote-first business operations.

## Business Context
The organization adopted cloud platforms to enable scalability,
agility, and global access. This shift required a centralized cloud
security strategy to manage identity, access, monitoring, compliance,
and incident readiness without slowing down engineering or business teams.

## Scope of the Program
- Cloud Identity & Access Management (IAM)
- Multi-account / multi-subscription security governance
- Centralized logging and monitoring
- Security posture management and threat detection
- Data protection and encryption
- Incident detection and response readiness

## Cloud Platforms
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure

## Key Responsibilities
- Defined cloud security standards, baselines, and guardrails
- Designed least-privilege access models for cloud resources
- Established centralized visibility across cloud environments
- Partnered with engineering, IT, and business stakeholders
- Provided leadership and guidance on secure cloud adoption

## Security Controls Implemented

### Identity & Access Management
- Designed role-based access control aligned with job functions
- Enforced least-privilege principles for users and service accounts
- Implemented centralized identity governance and access reviews
- Secured privileged access using strong authentication mechanisms

### Logging, Monitoring & Visibility
- Centralized cloud audit logs for security visibility and investigations
- Enabled continuous monitoring for suspicious activities
- Integrated alerts into security operations workflows
- Established log retention policies to support compliance and forensics

### Threat Detection & Security Posture
- Enabled native cloud security monitoring capabilities
- Monitored misconfigurations and policy violations
- Implemented continuous security posture assessments
- Defined response workflows for cloud security alerts

### Data Protection & Encryption
- Ensured encryption of data at rest and in transit
- Defined standards for key management and rotation
- Implemented secure storage and access patterns
- Reduced risk of data exposure through secure configuration standards

### Governance & Compliance Alignment
- Aligned cloud controls with GDPR and PCI DSS requirements
- Documented cloud security policies and procedures
- Supported audit and compliance evidence collection
- Defined exception and risk acceptance processes

## Incident Response & Readiness
- Integrated cloud environments into incident response playbooks
- Enabled rapid investigation using centralized logs
- Coordinated with incident response teams during cloud security events
- Conducted post-incident reviews and control improvements

## Outcomes
- Improved visibility and control across cloud environments
- Reduced security misconfigurations and access risks
- Faster detection and response to cloud-related security events
- Strong alignment between cloud adoption and security governance
- Increased confidence from business and leadership stakeholders
